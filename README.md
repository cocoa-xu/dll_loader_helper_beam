Add a directory to DLL search path for Windows. 

Say you are building a library, `library_name`, which loads some 3rd party shared libraries from
`code:priv_dir(library_name)/lib`. It's quite easy to add rpath on *nix systems, but we don't really have rpath in Windows. 

Therefore, we have to use [`AddDllDirectory`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-adddlldirectory) to manually add the directory that contains these
.dll files to the search path.

## Usage

```erlang
:ok = 
  case os:type() of
    {win32, nt} -> dll_loader_helper_beam:add_dll_directory("/SOME/DIRECTORY")
    _ -> ok
  end
```

Note that calling `dll_loader_helper_beam:add_dll_directory/1` on *nix systems will NOT have any effect, and `ok` will be returned.
